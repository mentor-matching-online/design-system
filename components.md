Components are reusable parts of the user interface that have been made to support a variety of applications.

You can use individual components in many different patterns and contexts. For example, you can use the text input component to ask for an email address, or someoneâ€™s name.

Each component in the Design System has coded examples. Some components also have Markdown examples that make it easy to override defaults in the [Mentor Matching Online Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mentor-matching-online/jekyll-theme).
